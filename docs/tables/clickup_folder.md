# Table: clickup_folder

Obtain information about folders within your ClickUp environment.

However you **MUST** specify either an `id` (single) or `space_id` (for multiple tasks) in the WHERE or JOIN clause.

> Note: by default `archived` items won't be returned, to return archived items only set `archived = true` in the where clause.

## Examples

### Get a folder by id

```sql
select
  id,
  name,
  order_index,
  hidden,
  space_id,
  task_count,
  archived
from
  clickup_folder
where
  id = '7fsd72'
```

### List all folders for a specific space

```sql
select
  id,
  name,
  order_index,
  hidden,
  space_id,
  task_count,
  archived
from
  clickup_folder
where
  space_id = '54649813'
```
