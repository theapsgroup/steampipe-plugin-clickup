# Table: clickup_task

Obtain information about tasks assigned to a specific team within your ClickUp environment.

However you **MUST** specify either an `id` (single) or either a `list_id` or `team_id` (for multiple tasks) in the WHERE or JOIN clause.

> Note: by default `archived` items won't be returned, to return archived items only set `archived = true` in the where clause.

## Examples
